### [A.I. Is Prompting an Evolution, Not Extinction, for Coders](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/business/ai-coding-software-engineers.html)

This article is yet another entry in the debate on whether or not AI will replace human programmers. The general opinion of the article seems to be that AI programming tools will be a very big help to programmers, as their skills shift more to being creative than writing code. Overall the article views AI in a very positive light, though it does seem to gloss over the question of what happens to junior developers as AI takes over programming. The article mentions that it is too early to truely guage the effect of AI on the hiring on junior developers, and also talks about the existence of programs that focus on teaching students how to develop with AI tools. A common beginner trap for programmers in the modern day is to become too reliant on AI tools, leaving them unable to properly debug or understand their code, which leads to a lot of problems down the line, but hopefully these sort of courses can properly prepare new developers. Personally I believe the real focus on AI tools should be on how they affect junior developers, as they are the next wave of senior developers that will be expected to maintain and expand major systems, rather than its effect on senior programmers who only need it as a fancy autocomplete.

**Comment from Sara**

I agree with your point that the most overlooked issue in the article is the impact of AI tools on junior developers. I also noticed that while the article is optimistic about AI improving productivity, it does not really address how new developers are supposed to build strong foundational skills in this environment.

What stood out to me is your mention of over-reliance on AI as a beginner trap. I think this is especially important because junior developers are still learning how to reason through problems and debug their own code. If AI tools are used too early as a replacement rather than a support, it could make that learning process weaker. In the long run, this matters more than how senior developers use AI, since juniors are the ones who will eventually be responsible for maintaining and expanding large systems. From my own research, many companies have also reported concerns that interns’ problem-solving abilities have declined due to over-reliance on AI tools.
